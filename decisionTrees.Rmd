This is an R Markdown document tracks R examples, exercises used in Stats202 lectures.

# Decision trees

Function "rpart" generated decision trees in R. Does classification and regression. For classification, ensure rpart() knows you're predicting (y) a factor, not numeric, variable.
```{r}
library(rpart)
```

## In class exercise #25

Read sonar datasets of 60 attr and 100 obs.

```{r}
setwd("./data")
##download.file("nice redirects google","sonar_train.csv", method="curl")
##download.file("https://sites.google.com/site/stats202/data/sonar_train.csv",
##              "sonar_test.csv",method="curl")

train<-read.csv("sonar_train.csv",header=F)
test<-read.csv("sonar_test.csv",header=F)

setwd("../")
```

Fit a decision tree to predict where obj is metal or a rock.

```{r}
## set the y var as factor for class prediction.
y<-as.factor(train[,61])
## set the remaining colums to be test data.
x<-train[,1:60]
## train model to predict y using all x.
fit<-rpart(y~.,x)

## or fit1<-rpart(as.factor(train$V61)~.,data=train)
```

How accurate did model predict y? 

```{r}
sum(y!=predict(fit,x,type="class"))/length(y)

## predict(fit,x,type="class") yields what you were trying to predict e.g., column 61. 
## So, take sum of instances where prediction != col61 and divide by total obs.
## Yields training set error rate of 11%.
```

Let's run against test set.

```{r}
## set the y_test var as factor for class prediction.
y_test<-as.factor(test[,61])
## set the remaining colums to be test data.
x_test<-test[,1:60] 
## Note we took out building the model. 

sum(y_test!=predict(fit,x_test,type="class"))/length(y_test)
## Note: Still used original fit model. 
## Now test error is 30%.
```

## In calss exercise #26: Toggle rpart() parms

Re-train model using train set and depth = 1. Test against training test set.

```{r}
fit<-rpart(y~.,x,control=rpart.control(maxdepth=1)) 
## check for fit on training data.
sum(y!=predict(fit,x,type="class"))/length(y)
```

Test against test set.
```{r}
## check for fit using old model and new test data.
sum(y_test!=predict(fit,x_test,type="class"))/length(y_test)
```

## In class exercise #27: Force a 6 depth tree.

Need to change a number of parms to over-depth tree.

```{r}
fit<-rpart(y~.,x,control=rpart.control(minsplit=0,
                                       minbucket=0,
                                       cp=-1,
                                       maxcompete=0,
                                       xval=0,
                                       maxdepth=6,)) 
sum(y!=predict(fit,x,type="class"))/length(y)
## training error 0. Overfit. 
```

Test against test set.

```{r}
## check for fit of new model using test data.
sum(y_test!=predict(fit,x_test,type="class"))/length(y_test)
## 0.27. Slightly better, but complex. Hard to understand. 
```
